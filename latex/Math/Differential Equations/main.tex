\section{General Remarks}    
    
\begin{remark}
    Moving to a bigger space in which we keep track of everything that is relevant for the evolution of our system is called ‘working in \textbf{phase space}’: The phase space of a general $n$th order ODE is the space of all possible times, positions, and ﬁrst $n - 1$ derivatives of the position. For a ball in ﬂight we could take the phase space to simply be the position and velocity of the ball; more accurate treatment might include additional variables to keep track of how the ball is spinning etc. (TBM)
