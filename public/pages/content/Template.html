    		<p>Dimensions comes naturally when speaking of “vectors" as arrows that
	        live in our geometric space. The zero dimension vector will just be
	        thought of as a point with no direction, one dimension vector an arrow
	        on a line, two dimension vector on a plane, three dimension an arrow in
	        the space that we live in.</p>	
	        <p>To use the notion of dimension for our generalized vector space, we
	        want to observe how vectors behave in the space. If you just have two
	        vectors sitting on the one-dimensional line, no matter how you add them
	        or scale them, they stay on that line. This is the notion that they are
	        linearly dependent. But once the second vector deviates away from the
	        line, in other words, once it has some component perpendicular to the
	        line, it “opens up" another dimension and span into the 2 dimensional
	        space. Then you get two linearly independent vectors. Now we generalize
	        this concept in vector space:</p>
