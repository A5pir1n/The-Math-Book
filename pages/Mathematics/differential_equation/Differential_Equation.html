        <p>Moving to a bigger space in which we keep track of everything that is
        relevant for the evolution of our system is called ‘working in
        <strong>phase space</strong>’: The phase space of a general <span
        class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>th order ODE is the space of all
        possible times, positions, and ﬁrst <span
        class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> derivatives of the position.
        For a ball in ﬂight we could take the phase space to simply be the
        position and velocity of the ball; more accurate treatment might include
        additional variables to keep track of how the ball is spinning etc.
